# Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

2. Git Commits:
   - When finishing a task, always output a git commit command
   - Include a descriptive commit message that follows conventional commit format

3. Documentation:
   - Update README.md when making significant changes, such as:
     * Adding new features or settings
     * Changing existing functionality
     * Updating system requirements
     * Adding new dependencies
   - Include clear descriptions of new features and how to use them
   - Keep the documentation in sync with the codebase
   - Add examples where appropriate

4. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval
   - If a lint rule needs to be disabled, ask the user first and explain why
   - Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling the lint rule
   - Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason
