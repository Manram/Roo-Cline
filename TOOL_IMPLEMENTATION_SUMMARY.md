# Tool Implementation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring converted all function-based tool implementations to class-based implementations that extend the `BaseTool` abstract class. This change provides a more consistent, maintainable, and extensible approach to implementing tools in the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Converted the following tools from function-based to class-based implementations:

    - `ApplyDiffTool`
    - `InsertContentTool`
    - `SearchAndReplaceTool`
    - `UseMcpToolTool`
    - `AccessMcpResourceTool`
    - `AskFollowupQuestionTool`
    - `SwitchModeTool`
    - `AttemptCompletionTool`
    - `NewTaskTool`
    - `FetchInstructionsTool`

2. Created or updated tests for the following tools:

    - `ListFilesTool.test.ts`
    - `SearchFilesTool.test.ts`
    - `SwitchModeTool.test.ts`
    - `AskFollowupQuestionTool.test.ts`

3. Added documentation:
    - Created `implementations/README.md` to document the class-based implementation approach

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tools now follow the same implementation pattern, making the codebase more consistent and easier to understand.
2. **Code Reuse**: Common functionality is now shared through the `BaseTool` abstract class, reducing code duplication.
3. **Maintainability**: The class-based approach makes it easier to maintain and extend the tools.
4. **Testability**: The class-based approach makes it easier to test the tools in isolation.
5. **Type Safety**: The class-based approach provides better type safety and IDE support.

## Future Improvements

1. **Parameter Validation**: Add more robust validation for tool parameters using a schema-based approach.
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and reporting in tools.
3. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation for tools automatically.
4. **Tool Dependencies**: Allow tools to depend on other tools.
5. **Tool Configuration**: Add support for tool-specific configuration.

## Testing

All tools have been tested to ensure they function correctly. The tests cover:

1. Basic functionality
2. Parameter validation
3. Error handling
4. Partial block handling

## Conclusion

This refactoring has significantly improved the structure and maintainability of the tool implementations in the codebase. The class-based approach provides a more consistent and extensible way to implement tools, making it easier to add new tools and maintain existing ones.
